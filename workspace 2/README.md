Hello! If you are reading this greetings fellow developer :)

Ok so here is what I used:

Foundation: for buttons and the carousel (Orbit)
--> actually did not use the grid, used simple flex box instead
--> although next iteration should definitely use foundations grid

Created one breakpoint at 500px
--> flex box took care of most of the responsiveness but had to add a point there to scale the nav image
--> definitely needs more breakpoints

Parallax background was created with plain css

Did not add a sticky navigation --> couldn't get it to stick, I think it is because of the parallax feature
--> need to find out how to get the foundation sticky nav to work, if you can awesome!!

There is a contact form through wufoo but it is under my name
-->need to make a new form with the administrators info


The paypal button is up but not connected to paypal, need the login info in order to get it hooked up



Well that's all I can think of! Hope it was helpful :)
